# Pintrest UI

## Description
Hello Everyone! 

Just thought I would try a full session of coding and show you what my workflow looks like for front end development. In this project I took a simple clean redesign of Pintrest that I found online on uplabs and then recreated it with Vuetify. As you can see the material design framework is really powerful and can speed up your workflow significantly. 

The end result is what you see in this project [here](https://uzirthapa.github.io/facebook-ui/dist/)
